# **Euclideon Vault Client Translation Guide**

## Getting Started with a New Translation

Translation files live in `/assets/lang/` and are named using the ISO standards [ISO 639-1](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) and [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). The Australian English translation is therefore `en-AU.json`.

It is recommended to start a new translation by copying the `en-AU.json` file as this is the official translation.

The top of the file needs info on the translation:
- `langkey`: This is the ISO 639-1 key for the language (or `null` if not applicable)
- `countrykey`: This is the ISO 3166-1 key for the country (or `null` if not applicable)
- `localname`: Is the name of the translation in the language (so users of that language can see it in the list)
- `englishname`: Is the name of the translation in English so the developers at Euclideon know what it is.
- `translationby`: This is your name so you can be credited for your work.
- `contactemail`: This is your email so you can be credited for your work.

The `languages.json` file contains the list of languages that Euclideon Vault Client will offer to the end user. This is checked after boot (not necessarily immediately at startup) to include new language packs. This also gets cached in the users settings directory.

Some strings support optional parameters that will be generated by the application. These are accessed using `{n}` where n is the index for the parameter starting from 0. The string that concatenates Latitude, Longitude and Altitude, `gisInfoLatLongAlt` has 3 parameters, `{0}` for latitude, `{1}` for longitude and `{2}` for altitude so the localized string is `Lat: {0}, Lon: {1}, Alt {2}`. There are no restrictions on the order of these parameters in the localized string, nor a restriction on the count. `{1}, {0}, {1}` were the parameters are `[Apple, Orange]` would output `Orange, Apple, Orange`.

The json file should be saved in UTF-8 with no byte order mark. Code page 65001 is recommended.
